# Real Estate Project Development Docker Image

This repository contains the Docker setup for the Real Estate Project. The Dockerfile is based on the `python:3.10.0-slim-buster` image and sets up the environment for developing the project.

## Dockerfile Overview

The Dockerfile performs the following tasks:
- Sets up the base image and environment variables.
- Installs necessary system dependencies.
- Upgrades `pip`.
- Copies and installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Prepares entrypoint and start scripts for running the application.

## Dockerfile Contents

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.0-slim-buster

ENV APP_HOME=/app
RUN mkdir $APP_HOME
RUN mkdir $APP_HOME/staticfiles

RUN sed -i 's/\r$//g' /entrypoint
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint

COPY ./docker/local/django/start /start
RUN sed -i 's/\r$//g' /start
RUN chmod +x /start

ENTRYPOINT [ "/entrypoint"]
```

### Entry Point Script

The `entrypoint` script is responsible for setting up the environment each time the container starts. Ensure that the script is executable and has Unix-style line endings.

### Start Script

The `start` script is used to run the Django development server. Like the `entrypoint` script, it must be executable and have Unix-style line endings.

## Environment Variables

- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`: Prevents Python from writing `.pyc` files to disk.
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: Ensures that the Python output is sent straight to the terminal (without being buffered).

## Maintainer

- **USER**: Manjil Gautam [Destiny]

# Docker Compose Configuration for Real Estate Project

This document provides an overview and usage instructions for the Docker Compose configuration used in the Real Estate Project.

## Overview

The Docker Compose file defines services and their configurations for orchestrating the Real Estate Project environment. It sets up two services: `api` and `postgres-db`, facilitating the development and database requirements.

### Services

- **api**: Service for running the Real Estate Project API.
- **postgres-db**: PostgreSQL database service for storing project data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download Docker Desktop, which includes Docker Compose, from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Configuration
