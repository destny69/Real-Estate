# Real Estate Project Development Docker Image

This repository contains the Docker setup for the Real Estate Project. The Dockerfile is based on the `python:3.10.0-slim-buster` image and sets up the environment for developing the project.

## Dockerfile Overview

The Dockerfile performs the following tasks:
- Sets up the base image and environment variables.
- Installs necessary system dependencies.
- Upgrades `pip`.
- Copies and installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Prepares entrypoint and start scripts for running the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Build the Docker Image

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-project.git
cd real-estate-project
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t real-estate-project:dev .
```

### Run the Docker Container

To run the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 8000:8000 real-estate-project:dev /start
```

### Entry Point Script

The `entrypoint` script is responsible for setting up the environment each time the container starts. Ensure that the script is executable and has Unix-style line endings.

### Start Script

The `start` script is used to run the Django development server. Like the `entrypoint` script, it must be executable and have Unix-style line endings.

## Environment Variables

- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`: Prevents Python from writing `.pyc` files to disk.
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: Ensures that the Python output is sent straight to the terminal (without being buffered).
